**E-Commerce Platform with Server-Side Rendering**

Developed a sophisticated e-commerce website leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) to ensure optimal performance and SEO. Utilized TypeScript for type safety, enhancing code reliability and maintainability. Integrated Prisma for efficient data management and querying with a NoSQL database, enabling scalable and flexible data handling.

Key Features:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Implemented with Next.js to enhance page load times and improve SEO by pre-rendering pages on the server.
- **TypeScript:** Employed to provide static typing, reducing bugs and improving the development workflow.
- **Prisma:** Used for seamless and performant interaction with a NoSQL database, ensuring reliable data operations.
- **React:** Leveraged for building dynamic and responsive UI components, delivering a modern and intuitive user experience.

This project highlights my ability to build a performant, scalable, and feature-rich e-commerce platform using a modern tech stack.

### Significance

Merging a user's cart when they log in to an eCommerce website ensures a seamless and convenient shopping experience. Here are several reasons why this practice is beneficial:

`Improved User Experience`:

**Continuity**: Users often start adding items to their cart while browsing without logging in. Merging the carts ensures that they don’t lose their selections when they decide to log in or create an account, providing a smooth and uninterrupted shopping experience.

**Convenience**: It saves users from the hassle of having to add items again, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.

`Increased Sales`:

**Reduced Abandonment**: A seamless transition from guest to logged-in state reduces the chances of cart abandonment. Users are more likely to complete their purchase if their selected items are retained.

**Encourages Account Creation**: Knowing that their cart will be preserved may encourage more users to create accounts, which can help in building a customer database for marketing and personalized services.

`Personalization`:

**Tailored Experience**: When carts are merged, the eCommerce platform can provide personalized recommendations and offers based on the combined data from both the guest and logged-in states.

**Consistent Tracking**: It allows for better tracking of user behavior and preferences, which can be used to enhance the shopping experience through personalized marketing and promotions.

`Data Integration`:

**Unified Data**: Merging carts ensures that all user interactions are recorded under a single user profile, providing a comprehensive view of the customer’s shopping behavior and preferences.

**Analytics**: It improves the accuracy of analytics and reporting, enabling better decision-making regarding inventory, marketing strategies, and customer service.

`Enhanced Functionality`:

**Wishlist Integration**: Items added to the cart while logged out can be easily moved to a wishlist when the user logs in, providing more flexibility in managing their desired products.

**Cross-Device Shopping**: Users often browse on multiple devices. Merging carts ensures that they can start shopping on one device and complete the purchase on another without losing their cart items.

`Operational Efficiency`:

**Simplified Management**: It simplifies the backend processes for managing carts and inventory. There’s no need to handle separate carts for logged-in and guest users, reducing complexity and potential errors.

**Stock Management**: Helps in maintaining accurate inventory levels, as duplicate carts can lead to discrepancies in stock availability.

In summary, merging a guest user's cart with their logged-in cart enhances the user experience, encourages account creation, increases sales potential, enables better personalization, and streamlines eCommerce operations.
